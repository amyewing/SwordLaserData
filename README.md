Sword and Laser Book Pick Data for Visualization
Data is separated into two CSV files.
Sword and Laser Book Picks Main Info contains most of the demographic and count based data.
Sword and Laser Book Picks Author contains author related information.
The two files are related using the seq and seq(1) columns.

This separation ensures minimal double counting due to co-authored books when rendered as data visualizations in Tableau.
